# Simple Favicon PSD Template

Inspired by [App Icon Template](http://appicontemplate.com/ios7) and [HTML5 Boilerplate Favicon PSD-Template](http://drublic.de/blog/html5-boilerplate-favicons-psd-template/).

What's difference is that it has one big 512x512 size `apple-touch-icon.png` and includes one slice and meta-information for everything. You just need to include your favicon using smart object, "Save for Web" and no annoying photoshop default "images" folder and you're done. Worked great on retina Macbook Pro, retina devices and browsers, too.

If you run into some issues, [please post issues here](https://github.com/llahnoraa/favicon/issues). Thanks!
