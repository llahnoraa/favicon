# The New Favicon PSD Template

Inspired by [http://drublic.de/blog/html5-boilerplate-favicons-psd-template/](HTML5 Boilerplate Favicon PSD-Template).

What's difference is that it has one big 144x144 size `apple-touch-icon.png` and includes one slice and meta-information for everything. You just need to include your favicon using smart object, "Save for Web" and no annoying photoshop default "images" folder and you're done. Worked great on retina Macbook Pro, retina devices and browsers, too.
