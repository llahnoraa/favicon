# Simple Favicon PSD Template

Inspired by [App Icon Template](http://appicontemplate.com/ios7) and [HTML5 Boilerplate Favicon PSD-Template](http://drublic.de/blog/html5-boilerplate-favicons-psd-template/).

What's difference is that it has one big 1024x1024 size `apple-touch-icon.png` and includes one slice and meta-information for everything. You just need to include your favicon using smart object, "Save for Web" and no annoying photoshop default "images" folder and you're done. Or use [Slicy app](http://macrabbit.com/slicy/)! To use Slicy, in Photoshop layer, just change it `edit here` to `apple-touch-icon.png`. Worked great on retina Macbook Pro, retina devices and browsers, too.

# Demo markup
`<link rel="shortcut icon" href="img/apple-touch-icon.png">`

`<link rel="apple-touch-icon" href="img/apple-touch-icon.png">`
